### What our team learned

Through this project, our team learned how to write multi-threading, scraping articles from html by using jsoup, and designing the application using javafx.
Besides, our team also learned how to use the Github and resolve conflicts. Once, our team makes the github too much conflicts to be able to resolve conflict by themselves. Therefore, to resolve, we decide to let only 2 members push code to the repo, and merge code manually. Later, while continuing working on the project, we realize that there were some files we need to git ignore manually before committing to avoid conflict.


### Continued development

In future, we intend to scrape and store the articles into the database because our current version scrapes not enough number of articles because of internet connection for sometimes. Therefore, when users click reload, or fetch new articles, the system will only fetch some newest articles that have not been fetched before only.
